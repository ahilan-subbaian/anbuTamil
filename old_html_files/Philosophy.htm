<p>
We believe that the best name the parents can give to their lovely babies is a name with a good meaning! As simple as that! 
</p>
<p>
We receive many queries requesting us to choose names that are astrologically correct based on birth date, time, star, etc. While we respect the beliefs of such visitors, we do not believe in such an ideology and hence cannot respond to such queries.
</p>
<p>
Also, we cannot provide any names over the email as we don't have any unpublished collection. Whatever we have, we share them with the world right here! However, if you have difficulty accessing our site, you can contact us. You may want to try accessing the site a few times before considering this option, as we may not be able to return your queries in a timely manner!
